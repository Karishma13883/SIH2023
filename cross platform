This app uses a single codebase to build a mobile app that can run on multiple platforms. 
Cross-platform app development frameworks such as Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin allows developers to write code in a high-level programming language and then compile it into native code for different platforms. 
Cross-platform app development is generally faster and more cost-effective than native app development, but it can still result in some performance and user experience trade-offs.


///cross vs hybrid///


Hybrid and cross-platform mobile app development are both approaches to building mobile applications that can run on multiple platforms such as iOS and Android. 
However, they differ in their implementation and the technology used.

Hybrid app development involves building a single app that can run on multiple platforms using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Hybrid apps are essentially web apps that are wrapped in a native app container, which allows them to access native device features like the camera and accelerometer.
The app runs on the device using a built-in browser called a WebView. Hybrid apps are usually built using frameworks like Ionic, PhoneGap, and Apache Cordova.

On the other hand, cross-platform app development involves building an app using a single codebase that can be compiled natively for multiple platforms.
This approach typically uses a platform-specific framework that abstracts away the differences between the platforms, allowing developers to write code once and deploy it to multiple platforms.
Cross-platform apps are usually built using frameworks like React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter.
